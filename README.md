## What is this Repository?
The files in this repository are information for creating an adapter to convert an 87C510 chip to a 27C512.  
This allows custom-made chips to be replaced with general-purpose ones, facilitating ECU map rewriting.

## Background
Motronic 2.4 from 1997 to 2001 uses a custom-made chip called 87c510 made by Texas Instrument (TMS), and it is difficult to obtain a blank chip that can be written to, other than obtaining the ECU itself.  
Please refer to the following web site to identify your motorcycle model and chip

The author's R1100S and the earlier years of the R1150 series fall into this category.  
  
Since the 87c510 chip is not commercially available, we have created an adapter that allows conversion to the 27c512 chip, which is more readily available.  
This adapter was available on the market for a while, but is now discontinued.  
We have compiled the data and files necessary for ordering on this GitHub.

## Proven Manufacturers

As of 2022, the cost was about $120 including $30 shipping to Japan.  
Of course, you can also make your own.
